                        In this chapter we will learn about the physical state namely Gaseous state in a precise and ways. 
                        Any given substance may exist in solid liquid or gaseous state(phase) depending upon the magnitude of two opposite type of tendencies. Thay are:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="liststyle">
                        <li><strong><i>Mutual attraction/tendencies(MA):</i></strong> Tendencies to bind molecules together.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>So depending on these tendencies if</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a)MA >> ET The matter will exist in Solid form</li>

                    <p>
                        On the basis of condition of pressure and temperature the given substance may exist in all three forms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        for eg: Water at Pressure = 1atm
                        <br>At T = -10°C exist as Ice(Solid)
                        <br>At T = 27°C exist as Water(Liquid)
                        <br>At T = 100°C exist as Vapour(Gas)
                        <jumbotron>

                    <h3 class="mt-3"><strong>1)Measurement of Mass(W) of gas: </strong></h3>
                    <p>The Mass or amount of gas can be measured by weighing. The container in which gas is enclosed first weighed. Then the weight of the empty container is measured. The difference gives mass of the gas.</p>
                    <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="img/measurement of mass of gas.jpg">
                    <p class="mt-3">Now
                    <br>W<sub>gas</sub> = (W<sub>2</sub>-W<sub>1</sub>) Gram
                    <br>Where, 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W<sub>1</sub> = Weight of cylinder
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W<sub>2</sub> = Weight of cylinder with gas
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>2)Measurement of Volume(V) of gas: </strong></h3>
                  <p>Volume of the gas is total space ocupied by the gas.
                    <br><i>So volume of the gas will be equal to the volume of the container where the gas is kept(provided the container is empty initially).</i></p>

                    <p>Different units of volume is used so some common units and their relation is shown below:
                    
                      <br>
                      <div class="jumbotron">
                      1 m<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>3</sup> dm<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>3 </sup>L = 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>9</sup> mm<sup>3</sup></div></p>
                    

                    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>3)Measurement of Temperature(T):</strong></h3>
                    <p>Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. It can be measured in three different scale namely <i>Degree, Farenheit</i> and <i>Kelvin</i>. The SI unit of temperature is Kelvin(K). So in physical chemistry we will express temperature in Kelvin scale. The relation between Degree celcius and Kelvin scale is:
                      <br>
                      <div class="jumbotron">
                      K = °C + 273</div>
                      <br>
                      <br> The relation between the three different scale is shown below:</p>

                      <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>4)Measurement of Pressure(P):</strong></h3>
                      <p>Pressure is the perpendicular force acting per unit area.
                        <br>P = F/A
                        <br>The mks unit of pressure is Nm<sup>-2</sup> which is also called Pascal.
                        <br>And the CGS unit is dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>
                        <br>Relation between Pascal and dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> is:
                        <br>
                        <div class="jumbotron">
                        1 Pascal = 1 Nm<sup>-2</sup> = 10<sup>5</sup> dyne/cm<sup>2</sup></div> </p>
                        <p>The common unit of pressure is atm. The relation between different units of pressure is:
                        <div class="jumbotron">1 atm = 76 cmHg = 760 mmHg = 760 Torr = 1.01325*10<sup>3</sup> Nm<sup>-2</sup> = 101.325 KPa = 1.01325 bar</div></p>
                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Convert the following to atm?
                          <br>i) 57 cmHg &nbsp&nbspii) 380 Torr &nbsp&nbspiii) 20.265 KPa &nbsp&nbspiv) 190 mmHg
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>5)Density(D):</strong></h3>
                        <p>'Density' is the mass per unit volume of a substance. Which is given by m/V. For gases we use absolute density given by d = PM/RT which will be discussed throughly in later section.
                          <br>Vapour density is also used for gases expressed as M/2, where 'M' is Molar mass</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5">Gas Laws</h2>
                        <p>Gas laws are those laws which shows relation between any two of Pressure, Volume and Temperature keeping any third property and amount of gas constant are known as Gas laws.</p>
                    



                    <h3 class="mt-5"><strong>1) Boyle's law:</strong></h3>
                    <p> For a given amount of gas at constant temperature, pressure of any gas is inversely proportional to its volume.</p>
                   <p> Mathematical form:
                  <br>P <span class="symbol">α</span> 1/V (T = constant,  n = constant)
                   <br> P = k(1/V)   (k is a proportionaity  conatant and it is depends upon temperature and it is directly proportional to temperature)
                   <div class="jumbotron"><strong> P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>= P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></strong> (T, n = constant)</div>
                    <div class="jumbotron">(Trick: All these laws leads to universal gas law which is PV = nRT. In Boyle's law P and V are varied and T is constant so from universal gas law PV = nRT we can say that k may be equivalent to nRT. So k is directly proportional to T.) 
                    </div>

                    <strong>Question:</strong> Pressure of a gas confined in a cylinderof volume 10 L is 2 atm. What will be the volume if pressure increases by 50% ?

                    <br>P<sub>1</sub> = 2 atm,    V<sub>1</sub> = 10L

                    <br>Now P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> 
                            <br>= 2 × 10

                   <br>V<sub>1</sub> = 10L V<sub>2</sub> = 10 + 15 = 25L
                   <br>Now P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>
                   <br>5 × 10 = P<sub>2</sub> × 25
                   <br>P<sub>2</sub> = 5 × 10/25 = 2 atm

                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Calculate % change in pressure if % change in volume is 25%?
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong>
                    <br><i>Case 1: </i> Let the volume is decreasing
                    <br>V<sub>1</sub> = 100 V<sub>2</sub> = 75

                    <br>Now P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>
                    <br> 100 × 100 = P<sub>2</sub> × 75
                    <br>P<sub>2</sub> = 133.3

                    <br>Let the volume of one marble be V
                    <br>Before increasing Pressure: P<sub>1</sub> = 1 atm, V<sub>1</sub> = (1000 - 10V) mL
                    <br>After increasing Pressure: P<sub>2</sub> = 2 atm, V<sub>2</sub> = (625 - 10V) mL  
                    <br>Now P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>
                    <br> 1 × (1000 - 10V) = 2 × (625 -10V)
